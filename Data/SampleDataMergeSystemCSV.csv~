Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey indicates that
galaxies have preferred periodic redshift spacings of $\Delta z =$ 0.0102,
0.0246, and 0.0448 in the SDSS and strong agreement with the results from the
2dF GRS. The redshift spacings are confirmed by the mass density fluctuations,
the power spectrum $P(z)$ and $N_{pairs}$ calculations. Application of the
Hubble law results in galaxies preferentially located on co-moving concentric
shells with periodic spacings. The combined results from both surveys indicate
regular co-moving radial distance spacings of $31.7 \pm 1.8$ $h^{-1} Mpc$,
$73.4 \pm 5.8$ $h^{-1} Mpc$ and $127 \pm 21$ $h^{-1} Mpc$. The results are
consistent with oscillations in the expansion rate of the universe over past
epochs.

sigma models, which perturbatively are intimately related to the theory of
chiral differential operators (CDOs). The grading by charge and scaling
dimension is anomalous if the first Chern class of the target space is nonzero.
This has some nontrivial consequences for the chiral algebra. As an example, we
study the case where the target space is CP^1, and show that worldsheet
instantons trivialize the chiral algebra entirely. Consequently, supersymmetry
is spontaneously broken in this model. We then turn to a closer look at the
supersymmetry breaking from the viewpoint of Morse theory on loop space. We
find that instantons interpolate between pairs of perturbative supersymmetric
states with different fermionic numbers, hence lifting them out of the
supersymmetric spectrum. Our results reveal that a ""quantum"" deformation of the
geometry of the target space leads to a trivialization of the kernels of
certain twisted Dirac operators on CP^1.

Regularity of the solutions is ensured in several ways: First, the potentials
are represented using a spectral basis which is analytic at the cylindrical
axis. Second, the non-physical discontinuous boundary conditions at the
cylindrical corners are smoothed using a polynomial approximation to a steep
exponential profile. Third, the nonlinear term is evaluated in such a way as to
eliminate singularities. The resulting pseudo-spectral code is tested using
exact polynomial solutions and the spectral convergence of the coefficients is
demonstrated. Our solutions are shown to agree with exact polynomial solutions
and with previous axisymmetric calculations of vortex breakdown and of
nonaxisymmetric calculations of onset of helical spirals. Parallelization by
azimuthal wavenumber is shown to be highly effective.

an infinite-dimensional global symmetry. This symmetry is an extension of the
finite-dimensional symmetry G in three dimensions, after performing a further
circle reduction. There has not been universal agreement as to exactly what the
extended symmetry algebra is, with different arguments seemingly concluding
either that it is $\hat G$, the affine Kac-Moody extension of G, or else a
subalgebra thereof. Exceptional in the literature for its explicit and
transparent exposition is the extremely lucid discussion by Schwarz, which we
take as our starting point for studying the simpler situation of
two-dimensional flat-space sigma models, which nonetheless capture all the
essential details. We arrive at the conclusion that the full symmetry is
described by the Kac-Moody algebra G, although truncations to subalgebras, such
as the one obtained by Schwarz, can be considered too. We then consider the
explicit example of the SL(2,R)/O(2) coset, and relate Schwarz's approach to an
earlier discussion that goes back to the work of Geroch.

transition is approached.

At constant temperature and pressure, volume and energy exhibit strong
correlations of their slow fluctuations (defined by averaging over 0.5
nanosecond). These quantities, on the other hand, do not correlate
significantly with area, thickness, or chain order. The correlations are mainly
reported for the fluid phase, but we also give some results for the ordered
(gel) phase of two membranes, showing a similar picture. The cause of the
observed strong correlations is identified by splitting volume and energy into
contributions from tails, heads, and water, and showing that the slow
volume-energy fluctuations derive from van der Waals interactions of the tail
region; they are thus analogous to the similar strong correlations recently
observed in computer simulations of the Lennard-Jones and other simple van der
Waals type liquids [U. R. Pedersen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008, 100, 015701].

which a central super-massive black hole generates vast radiant luminosities
through the gravitational accretion of gas. Winds launched from a rotating
accretion disk surrounding the black hole are thought to play a critical role,
allowing the disk to shed angular momentum that would otherwise inhibit
accretion. Such winds are capable of depositing large amounts of mechanical
energy in the host galaxy and its environs, profoundly affecting its formation
and evolution, and perhaps regulating the formation of large-scale cosmological
structures in the early Universe. Although there are good theoretical grounds
for believing that outflows from active galactic nuclei originate as disk
winds, observational verification has proven elusive. Here we show that
structures observed in polarized light across the broad H-alpha emission line
in the quasar PG 1700+158 originate close to the accretion disk in an electron
scattering wind. The wind has large rotational motions (~4,000 km/s), providing
direct observational evidence that outflows from active galactic nuclei are
launched from the disks. Moreover, the wind rises nearly vertically from the
disk, favouring launch mechanisms that impart an initial acceleration
perpendicular to the disk plane.

accelerated expansion of the Universe and are responsible for most of the iron
ever produced. Although there is general agreement that the exploding star is a
white dwarf in a binary system, the exact configuration and trigger of the
explosion is unclear, which could hamper their use for precision cosmology. Two
families of progenitor models have been proposed. In the first, a white dwarf
accretes material from a companion until it exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass,
collapses and explodes. Alternatively, two white dwarfs merge, again causing
catastrophic collapse and an explosion. It has hitherto been impossible to
determine if either model is correct. Here we report the discovery of an object
in pre-supernova archival X-ray images at the position of the recent type Ia
supernova (2007on) in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1404. Deep optical images (also
archival) show no sign of this object. From this we conclude that the X-ray
source is the progenitor of the supernova, which favours the accretion model
for this supernova, although the host galaxy is older (6-9 Gyr) than the age at
which the explosions are predicted in the accreting models.

NpPd_{5}Al_{2} which transform directly from Curie paramagnets into
superconductors, reveals a new class of superconductor where local moments
quench directly into a superconducting condensate. A powerful tool in the
description of heavy fermion metals is the large N expansion, which expands the
physics in powers of 1/N about a solvable limit where particles carry a large
number (N) of spin components. As it stands, this method is unable to jointly
describe the spin quenching and superconductivity which develop in PuCoGa_{5}
and NpPd_{5}Al_{2}. Here, we solve this problem with a new class of large N
expansion that employs the symplectic symmetry of spin to protect the odd
time-reversal parity of spin and sustain Cooper pairs as well-defined singlets.
With this method we show that when a lattice of magnetic ions exchange spin
with their metallic environment in two distinct symmetry channels, they are
able to simultaneously satisfy both channels by forming a condensate of
composite pairs between between local moments and electrons. In the tetragonal
crystalline environment relevant to PuCoGa_{5} and NpPd_{5}Al_{2} the lattice
structure selects a natural pair of spin exchange channels, giving rise to the
prediction of a unique anisotropic paired state with g-wave symmetry. This
pairing mechanism predicts a large upturn in the NMR relaxation rate above
T_{c}, a strong enhancement of Andreev reflection in tunneling measurements and
an enhanced superconducting transition temperature T_{c} in Pu doped
Np_{1-x}Pu_{x}Pd_{5}Al_{2}.

three generic regimes of a system response to a slow ramp: (A) mean-field, (B)
non-analytic, and (C) non-adiabatic. In the last regime the limits of the ramp
speed going to zero and the system size going to infinity do not commute and
the adiabatic process does not exist in the thermodynamic limit. We support our

of determining the distance of Cepheids. Indeed, it allows a consistent
combination of angular and linear diameters of the star. We aim to determine
consistent projection factors that include the dynamical structure of the
Cepheids' atmosphere. Methods. Hydrodynamical models of delta Cep and l Car
have been used to validate a spectroscopic method of determining the projection
factor. This method, based on the amplitude of the radial velocity curve, is
applied to eight stars observed with the HARPS spectrometer. The projection
factor is divided into three sub-concepts : (1) a geometrical effect, (2) the
velocity gradient within the atmosphere, and (3) the relative motion of the
""optical"" pulsating photosphere compared to the corresponding mass elements
(hereafter fo-g). Both, (1) and (3) are deduced from geometrical and
hydrodynamical models, respectively, while (2) is derived directly from
observations. The Fe I 4896.439 A line is found to be the best one to use in
the context of IBW and SB methods. A coherent and consistent period-projection
factor relation (hereafter Pp relation) is derived for this specific spectral
line: p = [0.064 +- 0.020] log P + [1.376 +- 0.023]. This procedure is then
extended to derive dynamic projection factors for any spectral line of any
Cepheid. This Pp relation is an important tool for removing bias in the
calibration of the period-luminosity relation of Cepheids. Moreover, it reveals
a new physical quantity fo-g to investigate in the near future.

velocity, or gamma-velocity, which shows a systematic blueshift of about 2 km/s
compared to an axisymmetric rotation model of the Milky Way. This term is
either related to the space motion of the star and, consequently, to the
kinematic structure of our Galaxy, or it is the result of the dynamical
structure of the Cepheids' atmosphere. We aim to show that these residual
gamma-velocities are an intrinsic property of Cepheids. We observed nine
galactic Cepheids with the HARPS spectroscope, focusing specifically on 17
spectral lines. For each spectral line of each star, we computed the
gamma-velocity (resp. gamma-asymmetry) as an average value of the interpolated
radial velocity (resp. line asymmetry) curve. For each Cepheid in our sample, a
linear relation is found between the gamma-velocities of the various spectral
lines and their corresponding gamma-asymmetries, showing that residual
gamma-velocities stem from the intrinsic properties of Cepheids. We also
provide a physical reference to the stellar gamma-velocity: it should be zero
when the gamma-asymmetry is zero. Following this definition, we provide very
precise and physically calibrated estimates of the gamma-velocities for all
stars of our sample. To understand this very subtle gamma-asymmetry effect,
further numerical studies are needed. Cepheids' atmosphere are strongly
affected by pulsational dynamics, convective flows, nonlinear physics, and
complex radiative transport. Hence, all of these effects have to be
incorporated simultaneously and consistently into the numerical models to
reproduce the observed line profiles in detail.

The diffuse X-ray emission;Fig. 8 replaced;;10.1051/0004-6361:20077437;;astro-ph;http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/;"  Observations with space-borne X-ray telescopes revealed the existence of
soft, diffuse X-ray emission from the inner regions of planetary nebulae.
Although the existing images support the idea that this emission arises from
the hot shocked central-star wind which fills the inner cavity of a planetary
nebula, existing models have difficulties to explain the observations
consistently. We investigate how the inclusion of thermal conduction changes
the physical parameters of the hot shocked wind gas and the amount of X-ray
emission predicted by time-dependent hydrodynamical models of planetary nebulae
with central stars of normal, hydrogen-rich surface composition. The radiation
hydrodynamical models show that heat conduction leads to lower temperatures and
higher densities within a bubble and brings the physical properties of the
X-ray emitting domain into close agreement with the values derived from
observations. Depending on the central-star mass and the evolutionary phase,
our models predict X-ray [0.45--2.5 keV] luminosities between $10^{-8}$ and
$10^{-4}$ of the stellar bolometric luminosities, in good agreement with the
observations. Less than 1% of the wind power is radiated away in this X-ray
band. Although temperature, density, and also the mass of the hot bubble is
significantly altered by heat conduction, the dynamics of the whole system
remains practically the same. Heat conduction allows the construction of
nebular models which predict the correct amount of X-ray emission and at the
same time are fully consistent with the observed mass-loss rate and wind speed.
Thermal conduction must be considered as a viable physical process for
explaining the diffuse X-ray emission from planetary nebulae with closed inner
cavities. Magnetic fields must then be absent or extremely weak.

branch across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram until the white-dwarf domain is
reached, using various central-star models coupled to different initial
envelope configurations. Along each sequence the relevant line emissions of the
nebulae are computed and analysed. Maximum line luminosities in Hbeta and
[OIII] 5007A are achieved at stellar effective temperatures of about 65000K and
95000-100000K, respectively, provided the nebula remains optically thick for
ionising photons. In the optically thin case, the maximum line emission occurs
at or shortly after the thick/thin transition. Our models suggest that most
planetary nebulae with hotter (>~ 45000K) central stars are optically thin in
the Lyman continuum, and that their [OIII] 5007A emission fails to explain the
bright end of the observed planetary nebulae luminosity function. However,
sequences with central stars of >~ 0.6 Msun and rather dense initial envelopes
remain virtually optically thick and are able to populate the bright end of the
luminosity function. Individual luminosity functions depend strongly on the
central-star mass and on the variation of the nebular optical depth with time.
Hydrodynamical simulations of planetary nebulae are essential for any

In particular, our models do not support the claim of Marigo et.al (2004)
according to which the maximum 5007A luminosity occurs during the recombination
phase well beyond 100 000K when the stellar luminosity declines and the nebular
models become, at least partially, optically thick. Consequently, there is no
need to invoke relatively massive central stars of, say > 0.7 Msun, to account
for the bright end of the luminosity function.

bipolar planetary nebulae to directly constrain the shaping process. Methods:
We present observations of the dusty core of the extreme bipolar planetary
nebula Menzel 3 (Mz 3, Hen 2-154, the Ant) taken with the mid-infrared
interferometer MIDI/VLTI and the adaptive optics NACO/VLT. The core of Mz 3 is
clearly resolved with MIDI in the interferometric mode, whereas it is
unresolved from the Ks to the N bands with single dish 8.2 m observations on a
scale ranging from 60 to 250 mas. A striking dependence of the dust core size
with the PA angle of the baselines is observed, that is highly suggestive of an
edge-on disk whose major axis is perpendicular to the axis of the bipolar
lobes. The MIDI spectrum and the visibilities of Mz 3 exhibit a clear signature
of amorphous silicate, in contrast to the signatures of crystalline silicates
detected in binary post-AGB systems, suggesting that the disk might be
relatively young. We used radiative-transfer Monte Carlo simulations of a
passive disk to constrain its geometrical and physical parameters. Its
inclination (74 degrees $\pm$ 3 degrees) and position angle (5 degrees $\pm$ 5
degrees) are in accordance with the values derived from the study of the lobes.
The inner radius is 9$\pm$ 1 AU and the disk is relatively flat. The dust mass
stored in the disk, estimated as 1 x 10-5Msun, represents only a small fraction
of the dust mass found in the lobes and might be a kind of relic of an
essentially polar ejection process.

cosmic rays (CR's), the three-dimensional magnetic field structure, and
features of other ISM phases in the halo of NGC 253. We present a new sensitive
radio continuum map of NGC 253 obtained from combined VLA and Effelsberg
observations at lambda 6.2 cm. We find a prominent radio halo with a
scaleheight of the thick radio disk of 1.7 kpc. The linear dependence between
the local scaleheight of the vertical continuum emission and the cosmic ray
electron (CRE) lifetime requires a vertical CR bulk speed of 270 km s^-1. The
magnetic field structure of NGC 253 resembles an ``X''-shaped configuration
where the orientation of the large-scale magnetic field is plane-parallel only
in the inner regions of the disk and at small distances from the galactic
midplane. At larger galactocentric radii and further away from the midplane the
vertical component becomes important. This is most clearly visible at the
location of the ``radio spur'' southeast of the nucleus, where the magnetic
field orientation is almost vertical. We made a simple model for the dominant
toroidal (r,phi) magnetic field component using a spiral magnetic field with
prescribed inclination and pitch angle. The residual poloidal (r,phi,z)
magnetic field component which was revealed by subtracting the model from the
observations shows a distinct ``X''-shaped magnetic field orientation centered
on the nucleus. The orientation angle of the poloidal magnetic field is
consistent with a magnetic field transport described by the superposition of
the vertical CR bulk speed and the rotation velocity. Hence, we propose a disk
wind which transports cosmic rays, magnetic field, and (partially) ionized gas
from the disk into the halo.

VLA at lambda 6.2 cm in a mosaic with 15 pointings. The missing zero-spacing
flux density of the VLA mosaic was filled in using observations with the 100-m
Effelsberg telescope. We also obtained a new lambda 3.6 cm map from Effelsberg
observations and reproduced VLA maps at lambda 20 cm and lambda 90 cm. We find
a thin and a thick radio disk with exponential scaleheights of 0.3 kpc and 1.7
kpc at lambda 6.2 cm. The equipartition total magnetic field strength between 7
micro G and 18 micro G in the disk is remarkably high. We use the spectral
aging of the cosmic ray electrons (CREs) seen in the vertical profiles of the
spectral index to determine a lower limit for the global CR bulk speed as
(170+/-70) km/s. The linear correlation between the scaleheights and the CRE
lifetimes, as evident from the dumbbell shaped halo, requires a vertical CR
transport with a bulk speed of (300+/-30) km/s in the northeastern halo,
similar to the escape velocity of 280 km/s. This shows the presence of a ""disk
wind"" in NGC253. In the southwestern halo, the transport is mainly diffusive
with a diffusion coefficient of (2.0+/-0.2) 10E29 cm^2 s^-1. In the
northeastern halo, the CR transport is convective and more efficient than in
the southwestern halo. The luminous material is transported by the disk wind,
which can explain the different amounts of extra-planar HI, Halpha, and soft
X-ray emission in the two halo parts. Future low-frequency radio observations
will provide the data to analyze the vertical velocity profile of galactic
winds.

liquids compiled from different groups and supplemented by new measurements.
The main quantity of interest is the ""minimum slope"" of the $\alpha$ dielectric
loss plotted as a function of frequency in a log-log plot (i.e., the
numerically largest slope above the loss peak frequency). The data consisting
of 347 spectra for 53 liquids show prevalence of minimum slopes close to -1/2,
corresponding to approximate square-root-time dependence of the dielectric
relaxation function at short times. The paper further studies possible
correlations between minimum slopes and: 1) Temperature quantified via the
loss-peak frequency; 2) How well an inverse power law fits data above the loss
peak; 3) Degree of time-temperature superposition; 4) Loss-peak half width; 5)
Deviation from non-Arrhenius behavior; 6) Loss strength. For the first three
points we find correlations that indicate a special status of liquids with
minimum slopes close to -1/2. For the last three points only fairly
insignificant correlations are found with the exception of large-loss liquids,
which have minimum slopes that are numerically significantly larger than 1/2
and loss peak widths that are significantly smaller than those of most other
liquids. We conclude that -- excluding large-loss liquids -- approximate $\sqrt
t$ relaxation appears to be a generic property of the $\alpha$ relaxation of
organic glass formers.

obeyed. These findings suggest that square-root-time relaxation is generic to
the alpha process, once a common view, but since long believed to be incorrect.
Only liquids with very large dielectric losses deviate from this picture by
having consistently narrower loss peaks. As a further challenge to the
prevailing opinion, we find that liquids with accurate square-root-time

is more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the

Stokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the
observed amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from the

flux regions in the network. The differences between these regions become more
pronounced with height as the plasma-$\beta$ decreases. These inversions

obtained toward the starless globule FeSt 1-457 in order to investigate its
kinematics and chemistry. The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed and
asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observed
asymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the
outer layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic and
significantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our
observations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is
gravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggest
that the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the
outer layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state near
hydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+
confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internal
support. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsation
would be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule due
to the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for the
double-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinction
maps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinction
data provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ while

  Globule?";"to appear in ApJ vol 665 20 August 2007;";;10.1086/519272;;astro-ph;;"  High resolution molecular line observations of CS, HCO+, C18O and N2H+ were
obtained toward the starless globule FeSt 1-457 in order to investigate its
kinematics and chemistry. The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed and
asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observed
asymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the
outer layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic and
significantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our
observations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is
gravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggest
that the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the
outer layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state near
hydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+
confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internal
support. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsation
would be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule due
to the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for the
double-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinction
maps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinction
data provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ while
N2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visual
extinction.

a fully developed turbulence spectrum and show that resonant interactions of
particles with high speed waves dominate the acceleration process. To produce
the relativistic electrons inferred from the broadband spectrum of a few
well-observed shell-type supernova remnants in the leptonic scenario for the
TeV emission, fast mode waves must be excited effectively in the downstream and
dominate the turbulence in the subsonic phase. Strong collisionless
non-relativistic astrophysical shocks are studied with the assumption of a
constant Aflven speed. The energy density of non-thermal electrons is found to
be comparable to that of the magnetic field. With reasonable parameters, the
model explains observations of shell-type supernova remnants. More detailed
studies are warranted to better understand the nature of supernova shocks.

Sr2YRuO6 are reported here. Magnetization measurements as a function of
temperature in low magnetic fields show clear evidence for two components of
magnetic order (TM1 ~ 32K and TM2 ~ 27K) aligned opposite to each other with
respect to the magnetic field direction even though only Ru5+moments can order
magnetically in this compound. The second component of the magnetic order at
TM2 ~ 27K results only in a magnetization reversal, and not in the negative
magnetization when the magnetization is measured in the field cooled (FC) mode.
Isothermal magnetization (M-H) measurements show hysteresis with maximum
coercivity (Hc) and remnant magnetization (Mr) at T ~ 27 K, corroborating the
presence of the two oppositely aligned magnetic moments, each with a
ferromagnetic component. The two components of magnetic ordering are further
confirmed by the double peak structure in the heat capacity measurements. These
anomalous properties have significance to some of the earlier results obtained
for the Cu-substituted superconducting Sr2YRu1-xCuxO6 compounds.

supergravity in five dimensions. The corresponding superspace constraints are
invariant under super-Weyl transformations generated by a real scalar
parameter. The minimal supergravity multiplet, which was introduced by Howe in
1981, emerges if one couples the Weyl multiplet to an Abelian vector multiplet
and then breaks the super-Weyl invariance by imposing the gauge condition W=1,
with W the field strength of the vector multiplet. The geometry of superspace
is shown to allow the existence of a large family of off-shell supermultiplets
that possess uniquely determined super-Weyl transformation laws and can be used
to describe supersymmetric matter. Many of these supermultiplets have not
appeared within the superconformal tensor calculus. We formulate a manifestly
locally supersymmetric and super-Weyl invariant action principle. In the
super-Weyl gauge W=1, this action reduces to that constructed in
arXiv:0712.3102. We also present a superspace formulation for the dilaton Weyl
multiplet.

foundation for further studies. We show that the energy of the spin density
wave (SDW) in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ is lowered through exotic exchange splitting of
the band structure, rather than Fermi surface nesting of itinerant electrons.
This clearly demonstrates that a metallic SDW state could be solely induced by
interactions of local magnetic moments, resembling the nature of
antiferromagnetic order in cuprate parent compounds.

observable sector, and must be embedded in a locally supersymmetric theory
which arises from string theory. For phenomenological reasons it must also
transmit supersymmetry from the hidden to the visible sector in a dominantly
flavor neutral manner. Also any such theory of supersymmetry breaking has to
take into account the problem of quadratic divergences which arise once the
theory is embedded in supergravity. A class of possible models that arise from
GKP-KKLT type IIB string compactifications, incorporating all this while being
consistent with gauge unification, with just the bare minimum of necessary
supergravity/string theory moduli fields coupled to the minimally
supersymmetric standard model, is presented. Such models give reasonable values
for the soft masses, the $\mu$ and $B\mu$ terms and the gaugino masses.
Assuming that an actual detailed realization exists, it is very likely that
they are the simplest such possibility .

communities influence each other'' and ``when two given communities do
communicate''. We prove that, for a small-world network, among communities, a
simple superposition principle applies and each community plays the role of a
microscopic spin governed by a sort of effective TAP (Thouless, Anderson and
Palmer) equations. The relative susceptibilities derived from these equations
calculated at finite or zero temperature (where the method provides an
effective percolation theory) give us the answers to the above issues. As for
the already studied case n=1, these equations are exact in the paramagnetic
regions (at T=0 this means below the percolation threshold) and provide
effective approximations in the other regions. However, unlike the case n=1,
asymmetries among the communities may lead, via the TAP-like structure of the
equations, to many metastable states whose number, in the case of negative
short-cuts among the communities, may grow exponentially fast with n and glassy
scenarios with a remarkable presence of abrupt jumps take place. Furthermore,
as a byproduct, from the relative susceptibilities a natural and efficient
method to detect the community structure of a generic network emerges.

local interactions with a spin chain with nontrivial internal dynamics
(governed by an XY Hamiltonian). Special attention is payed to the transition
between two limits: one in which both qubits interact with the same site of the
chain and another one where they interact with distant sites. The two cases
exhibit different behaviours in the weak and strong coupling regimes: when the
coupling is weak it is found that decoherence tends to decrease with distance,
while for strong coupling the result is the opposite. Also, in the weak
coupling case, the long distance limit is rapidly reached, while for strong
coupling there is clear evidence of an expected effect: environment-induced
interactions between the qubits of the system. A consequence of this is the
appearance of quasiperiodic events that can be interpreted as ``sudden deaths''
and ``sudden revivals'' of the entanglement between the qubits, with a time
scale related to the distance between them.

locally with a spin chain with nontrivial internal Hamiltonian. We present an
exact solution to this problem and analyze the dependence of decoherence on the
distance between the interaction sites. In the strong coupling regime we find
that decoherence increases with increasing distance. In the weak coupling
regime the dependence of decoherence with distance is not generic (i.e., it
varies according to the initial state). Decoherence becomes independent of
distance when the latter is over a saturation length $l$. Numerical results for
the Ising chain suggest that the saturation scale is related to the correlation
length $\xi$. For strong coupling we display evidence of the existence of

  appear in Annals of Math";;10.1103/PhysRevA.79.035801;;math.NT;http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/;"  We show that the Mobius function mu(n) is strongly asymptotically orthogonal
to any polynomial nilsequence n -> F(g(n)L). Here, G is a simply-connected
nilpotent Lie group with a discrete and cocompact subgroup L (so G/L is a
nilmanifold), g : Z -> G is a polynomial sequence and F: G/L -> R is a
Lipschitz function. More precisely, we show that the inner product of mu(n)
with F(g(n)L) over {1,...,N} is bounded by 1/log^A N, for all A > 0. In
particular, this implies the Mobius and Nilsequence conjecture MN(s) from our
earlier paper ""Linear equations in primes"" for every positive integer s. This
is one of two major ingredients in our programme, outlined in that paper, to
establish a large number of cases of the generalised Hardy-Littlewood
conjecture, which predicts how often a collection \psi_1,...,\psi_t : Z^d -> Z
of linear forms all take prime values. The proof is a relatively quick
application of the results in our recent companion paper on the distribution of
polynomial orbits on nilmanifolds.
  We give some applications of our main theorem. We show, for example, that the
Mobius function is uncorrelated with any bracket polynomial. We also obtain a
result about the distribution of nilsequences n -> a^nxL as n ranges only over
the primes.

measurement of $g^{(2)}$ may, however, require high time-resolution devices, in
whose absence, only time-averaged measurements are accessible. These
time-averaged measures, standing alone, do not carry sufficient information for
proper characterization of SPSs. Here, we develop a theory, corroborated by an

SPSs that rely on continuous-wave parametric down-conversion. Our proposed
measures and analysis enable proper standardization of such SPSs.

vortex matter phase diagram and the nature of the coupling mechanism between
the Cu-O layers in the three-layer Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+delta (Bi-2223) compound.
Contrary to previous reports, in the overdoped (OD) regime we do find a
variation of Tc with increasing the oxygen partial-pressure of the
post-annealing treatment. This variation is less significant than in the
bi-layer parental compound Bi-2212 and does not follow the universal Tc
vs.delta relation. Magnetic measurements reveal that increasing delta enlarges
the field and temperature stability of the Bragg glass phase. These findings
imply that the interlayer coupling between Cu-O layers enhances with delta. The
anisotropy parameter estimated from directional first-penetration field
measurements monotonously decreases from 50 in the underdoped (UD) to 15 in the
OD regimes. However, the in-plane penetration depth presents a boomerang-like
behaviour with $\delta$, reaching its minimum value close to optimal doping.
These two facts lead to a crossover from a Josephson(OD) to
electromagnetic(UD)-dominated coupling of adjacent Cu-O layers in the vicinity
of optimal doping.
