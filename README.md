# pure-merge-system
GUI for merging two duplicate articles using a Machine Learning model to preselect fields.
Connects to one API to send the article data which returns the percent chance that it is a good field.
Connects to another API to upload the selected choices to a database.

This project saves time for users of the system, since they wouldn't have to spend as much time picking fields depending on the percentage returned by the API. The more the system is used, the more accurate the model will be.
